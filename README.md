# 🚜 Krishi-Route

Krishi-Route is a profit-first market and logistics optimizer that helps farmers identify the most profitable mandi to sell their produce by comparing market prices, transport costs, and distances.

## Problem Statement
Farmers often sell produce at the nearest mandi without calculating net profit. Krishi-Route enables data-driven selling decisions by recommending the mandi that maximizes profit, not proximity.
